# Introduction
Management system based on [**Spring MVC**](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc.html), [**Spring Framework**](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework), [**Mybatis**](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3) and [**Mybatis-plus**](https://github.com/baomidou/mybatis-plus) (SSM).

# About

- The code is originated from a third party, I don't know the source, my friend purchased this code and shared it with me. I am learning JavaEE and SSM accordingly and trying to make some custom changes to it.
- It's so outdated and I don't know anything about SSM, so getting it updated and changed could take some time, I'm not sure how long. If anyone is willing to help me out, I would greatly appreciate it! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: 
- When I'm done updating and changing it, the __master__ branch will merge into the __main__ branch.
